# SONCE
Meteor version of SONCE is up to be useed as edication tool and could be the new way of communication with as./prof./mentor while learning electronic by drawing and testing. Get focus on how circuit work not how to get simulation result. See topology of circuit, see all available matrixes.

## Ideas


## History
The idea started in 2007 as need for fast svg circuit editor as plugin for MediaWiki what was used for student's lecture notes.
First try was made with svg only with javascript inside - You can fork branck '''xeagle'''.

Than my colege come with C# knowladge and start building new version in Silverlight. This source code is avaliabe on http://sonce.codeplex.com/
I was very sceptical about SilverLight as i'm about all from M$.

Than i meet jQuery library and it blow my mind, so i made new branch '''SONCEjQ'''. It uses jquery.svg plugin. It generates svg while drawing and also build circuit xlm, but with nodes as root. Just like is needed in matrix to calculate circuit.

After many years of doing diferent things i switch from jQuery do nodejs and meet meteor. 2016 was also deadline to get my degree. So this come up.
