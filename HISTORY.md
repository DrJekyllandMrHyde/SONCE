## 0.3.0, 2016
After many years of doing different things I switched from jQuery to nodejs and
met meteor. In 2016 it was also deadline to get my degree. So this came up.

## 0.2.0, 2010
In 2010 I met the jQuery library and it blows my mind, so i made new branch [**SONCEjQ**](https://github.com/mitjajez/SONCE/tree/SONCEjQ). It uses
jquery.svg plugin. It generates svg while drawing and also build circuit's XML,
but with nodes as root (net-based netlist). Just like is needed in matrix to
calculate circuit.

## 2009
Then my colleague come with C# knowledge and start building new Silverlight
version. This source code is avaliabe on [codeplex](http://sonce.codeplex.com/).
I was very sceptical about SilverLight as i'm about all products from M$
(or. about close source in general)

## 0.1.0, 2007

- Initial public launch

The idea started in 2007 as need for fast svg circuit editor as plugin for
MediaWiki that was used for student's lecture notes. First try was made with
svg-only with javascript inside - You can fork
[**xeagle** branch](https://github.com/mitjajez/SONCE/tree/xeagle).
